 MFS Municipal High Income Fund Example This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that: you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and you redeem your shares at the end of the time periods (unless otherwise indicated); your investment has a 5% return each year; and the funds operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs will likely be higher or lower, under these assumptions your costs would be: 1 YEAR 3 YEARS 5 YEARS 10 YEARS Class A Shares $ 485 $ 622 $ 772 $ 1,208 Class B Shares assuming1 redemption at end of period $ 538 $ 794 $ 1,074 $ 1,672 no redemption at end of period $ 138 $ 494 $ 874 $ 1,672 Class C Shares assuming1 redemption at end of period $ 264 $ 519 $ 897 $ 1,694 no redemption at end of period $ 164 $ 519 $ 897 $ 1,694 Class I Shares $ 62 $ 206 $ 363 $ 818 Class R6 Shares $ 53 $ 180 $ 318 $ 720 1 Shares automatically convert to Class A shares approximately eight years after purchase; therefore, the expense examples reflect Class A share expenses after eight years. Portfolio Turnover The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when shares are held in a taxable account. These transaction costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the funds portfolio turnover rate was 18% of the average value of its portfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The fund invests, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its net assets in securities and other investments, the interest on which is exempt from federal income tax. Interest from the funds investments may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. MFS (Massachusetts Financial Services Company, the fund's investment adviser) normally invests the funds assets primarily in municipal instruments. MFS may invest 25% or more of the funds total assets in municipal instruments that finance similar projects, such as those relating to education, healthcare, housing, utilities, water, or sewers. MFS may invest up to 100% of the funds assets in below investment grade quality debt instruments. MFS may invest a significant percentage of the fund's assets in issuers in a single state, territory, or possession, or a small number of states, territories, or possessions. While MFS may use derivatives for any investment purpose, to the extent MFS uses derivatives, MFS expects to use derivatives primarily to increase or decrease exposure to a particular market, segment of the market, or security, to increase or decrease interest rate exposure, or as alternatives to direct investments. Derivatives include futures, forward contracts, options, inverse floating rate instruments, and swaps. MFS uses an active bottom-up investment approach to buying and selling investments for the fund. Investments are selected primarily based on fundamental analysis of individual instruments and their issuers. Quantitative screening tools that systematically evaluate instruments may also be considered. In structuring the fund, MFS also considers top-down factors.
